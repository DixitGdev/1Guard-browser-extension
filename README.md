# 1Guard - Two Factor Authenticator

## Project Goals
- This initiative revolves around the development of a browser extension specifically engineered for internal use that streamlines auto-authentication. 
- The product's core functionality encompasses providing Time-based One Time Passcodes, RSA SecureID passcodes, Yubikey passcodes, alongside other authentication algorithms as they are conceptualized and implemented.
- A salient feature of the product includes passcode management on a remote server, from where these codes are made available to the users for copying.
- Additionally, efforts are being channeled to incorporate an autofill feature into the extension, further enhancing its convenience.
- Despite the storage of OTP codes on a server, we adhere to stringent security measures by implementing End-to-End (E2E) encryption, ensuring the server never has access to unencrypted keys.

## Project Roadmap
- Currently the browser extension is in Internal use.
- The browser extension needs autofill features added in more places.
- The server code needs to be rewritten for Public use.
